Hello everyone! I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, Sapienza University of Rome.

My research interests regard many aspects of Formal Methods for Artificial Intelligence. In particular, I work on verification and synthesis for multi-agent systems, knowledge representation, strategic reasoning, logics, games, and automata theory.
