Hello! I am a third year PhD student in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome in the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering. My PhD is also in collaboration with Amazon. I am working under the guidance of Professor Fabrizio Silvestri and collaborating with the RSTless group. My research interests include Graph Neural Networks and Category Theory, with a focus on the environmental impact of deep learning algorithms. Prior to this, I completed my Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome.
