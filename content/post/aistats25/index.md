Understanding Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a challenging task, especially when it comes to interpreting their predictions. Counterfactual explanations provide an effective way to answer "what-if" questionsâ€”offering insights into how small changes in input data can lead to different model outcomes. However, traditional counterfactual methods often generate highly technical explanations, making them inaccessible to non-expert users.

ðŸ’¡ What does our work propose?

We introduce a novel approach that leverages open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform counterfactual explanations for GNNs into natural language descriptions. This allows for:

(i) More human-readable and intuitive explanations
(ii) Improved accessibility for non-expert users
(iii) Better transparency in critical applications, such as fraud detection, financial decision-making, and healthcare

ðŸ“Š Our method was evaluated using state-of-the-art counterfactual explainers and multiple graph datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness through both novel evaluation metrics and human assessments.
We believe this work is a step toward making AI explainability more interpretable and actionable! ðŸš€
