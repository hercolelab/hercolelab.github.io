In this work, we connect two key properties of machine learning models: **generalization** and **explainability**. Specifically, we show that the more a model overfits its training data, the easier it becomes, on average, to find counterfactual examples (i.e., small input perturbations that change the model's prediction).

Leveraging this observation, we propose **CF-Reg**, a new regularization term that mitigates overfitting by enforcing a sufficient margin between training samples and their counterfactuals.

Our experiments indicate that this strategy not only improves generalization but also produces counterfactual explanations naturally as a by product of the training process.
