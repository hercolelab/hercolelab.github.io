The article "Enhancing XAI Narratives through Multi-Narrative Refinement and Knowledge Distillation" by Flavio Giorgi, Matteo Silvestri and Gabriele Tolomei from the Department of Computer Science, in collaboration with Fabrizio Silvestri (DIAG) and Cesare Campagnano, received the [Best Paper Award](https://www.di.uniroma1.it/it/best-paper-award-la-ricerca-su-xai-narratives-con-llms-allhcai-workshop-acm-cikm-2025) at the [HCAI 2025 Workshop](https://xai.kaist.ac.kr/Workshop/hcai2025/) (Human-Centric AI: From Explainability and Trustworthiness to Actionable Ethics), co-located with the ACM CIKM 2025 international conference in Seoul, Korea.

The work contributes to advancing an extremely promising area of research in the field of human-centred Explainable AI, with the aim of making explanations of AI models more accessible, interpretable and useful in practical and critical contexts. The authors propose a new pipeline that leverages large and small language models (LLMs/SLMs) to generate coherent natural language narratives from counterfactual explanations for predictive models operating on tabular data.
